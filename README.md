# Exploring the Relationship Between Socioeconomic Factors and School Performance on Standardized Tests

## description
This project aims to investigate whether socioeconomic factors influence school performance on standardized tests, specifically the ACT or SAT exams in U.S. high schools.
## Data 
This project utilizes two data sets [EdGap_data.xlsx](https://github.com/Parsar22/Education/blob/1ef80dbb86f98226108ed3cc586b3e162da545f7/EdGap_data.xlsx) and [ccd_sch_029_1617_w_1a_11212017.csv](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HvW2w-o2XZzCm4KTvnb1Bb3BvoAa14BP/view?usp=sharing). The primary data set is the EdGap data set from [EdGap.org](https://www.edgap.org/#5/37.875/-96.987). This data set from 2016 includes information about average ACT or SAT scores for schools and several socioeconomic characteristics of the school district. The secondary data set is basic information about each school from [the National Center for Education Statistics](https://nces.ed.gov/ccd/pubschuniv.asp).
