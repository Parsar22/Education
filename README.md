# Exploring the Relationship Between Socioeconomic Factors and School Performance on Standardized Tests

## description
This project aims to investigate whether socioeconomic factors influence school performance on standardized tests, specifically the ACT or SAT exams in U.S. high schools.
## Data 
This project utilizes two data sets EdGap_data.xlsx and ccd_sch_029_1617_w_1a_11212017.csv. The primary data set is the EdGap data set from [EdGap.org](https://www.edgap.org/#5/37.875/-96.987). This data set from 2016 includes information about average ACT or SAT scores for schools and several socioeconomic characteristics of the school district. The [secondary data](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HvW2w-o2XZzCm4KTvnb1Bb3BvoAa14BP/view?usp=sharing.) set is basic information about each school from [the National Center for Education Statistics](https://nces.ed.gov/ccd/pubschuniv.asp).
